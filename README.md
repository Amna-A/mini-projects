# Mini Python Projects

collection of simple and short "one task" scripts.

## What's included ?

I'm going to add mostly simple and qick scripts for simple games or any small tools that comes to my mind and could fit the criteria of simple and short script.

## What are the topics?

Anything, really !. random mini projects.

## Why ?

I'm thinking that young or completly new programmers would want to look at very simple code, to help them with the way they could think and go about implimenting thier ideas in python.
It's also out here for me to track my progress with how I think with python !
